## GLSL Builder
This single header-only C++ helper class adds support for the #include and #pragma once (similar to that in C++), to GLSL.

Natively, GLSL does not support the "#include" and "#pragma once" macros.
However, as the number of shaders in a project grow, there is a high chance that much of the shader code are similar, leading to DRY being broken as multiple shaders having the same code copy-pasted.

While the ARB_shading_language_include extension exists, it is difficult to setup.

This is my attempt to solve that issue in a simple and elegant way.

## Bug Reporting
This is my first attempt at making this glsl_builder. If there are any bugs or suggestions, feel free to create a GitHub Issue, or even a Pull Request if you would like to add anything. ðŸ˜„

## How to Use
Sample Code:
```
#include "glsl_builder.h"

using namespace mkr;

string base = "#include <incl0.frag>\n"
              "#include <incl1.frag>\n"
              "void main() {}";

string incl0 = "#pragma once\n"
               "void foo() {}\n"
               "#include <incl2.frag>";

string incl1 = "#pragma once\n"
               "void bar() {}\n"
               "#include <incl2.frag>";

string incl2 = "void baz() {} // Has no #pragma once, can be included twice.";

glsl_builder builder;
builder.add("base.frag", base); 
builder.add("incl0.frag", incl0); // The first argument _name, must match the name between the arrow brackets <>.
builder.add("incl1.frag", incl1);
builder.add("incl2.frag", incl2);

string built = builder.build();
cout << built << endl;
```

Console Output:
```
void foo() {}
void baz() {} // Has no #pragma once, can be included twice.
void bar() {}
void baz() {} // Has no #pragma once, can be included twice.
void main() {}
```
